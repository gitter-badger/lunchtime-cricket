# lunchtime-cricket

A visual representation of cricket scores from FAC cricket to practice manipulating the DOM with vanilla javascript and layouts with vanilla CSS.

New idea for how to lay it out: a table with name in the first column, and score in the second. When the user clicks on a person's name, a CSS ball lights up which has a radius proportional to that person's score. The balls are stacked one on top of another and are normally hidden.
